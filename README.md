- 👋 Hi, I’m @houriziaeepour
- 👀 I’m interested in physics and astronomy, and sometimes computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to hack my old LG G4 phone such that I can flash a newer version of Android than its 6.0 !
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a new quantum gravity model. See  https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03428 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05757
